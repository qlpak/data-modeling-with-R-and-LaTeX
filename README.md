# Statistical Modeling & Regression Analysis using R and LaTeX

This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of log-returns for two major companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange: **LPP** and **Allegro**. All computations and visualizations were done in **R**, and the final report was written and formatted using **LaTeX**.

## 📌 Project Scope

- Computation of daily log-returns from stock prices
- Fitting theoretical distributions (Normal and t-Student)
- Goodness-of-fit testing: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér-von Mises
- Estimation of joint and marginal densities
- Multivariate analysis and covariance matrix calculation
- Linear regression modeling with diagnostic analysis
- Confidence interval estimation (analytical and bootstrap)
- Professional academic report generation in LaTeX

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **R** (RStudio, ggplot2, fitdistrplus, boot)
- **LaTeX** (compiled on Overleaf)
- **Markdown** (for documentation)

## 📁 Project Structure

- R script (all scripts in one file) for data analysis and modeling
- LaTeX source file of the report
- Final report (compiled PDF) 
- README.md (this file)

## 📊 Outputs and Visuals

The final report includes:
- Histograms and Q-Q plots
- Confidence intervals and bootstrapping results
- Regression diagnostics
- Fitted distributions and density curves
